# Resqure

ResQure is a powerful safety platform designed to help you respond swiftly in emergencies. Whether you're a victim of a dangerous situation or simply need peace of mind, ResQure provides key tools to alert your emergency contacts, record evidence, and ensure your safety.

## Features

### 1. **Basic SOS**
- **Location Tracking**: Sends your real-time location to your emergency contacts.
- **Audio & Video Recording**: Starts recording audio and video once the SOS is triggered, capturing important evidence of the situation.
- **Cloud Upload & Link Sharing**: The recorded data is securely uploaded to the cloud, and a link is sent to your emergency contacts, allowing them to access the footage immediately.

### 2. **High Alert SOS**
- **Live Location Tracking**: Tracks your live location and sends a real-time link to your emergency contacts, enabling them to monitor your whereabouts.
- **Hidden Recording**: Once activated, the screen blacks out, and the app starts recording in the background, without the userâ€™s screen being visible. This ensures that the user can safely record the incident without alerting anyone.
- **Cloud Upload**: Like the Basic SOS, all footage is safely uploaded to the cloud, ensuring that all emergency contacts have access to it for evidence and assistance.
